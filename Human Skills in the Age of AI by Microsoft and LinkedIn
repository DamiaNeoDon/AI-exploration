influenced by periods where an MBA
was perhaps more valuable?"


"Do the career paths for the MBA you
mention reflect current economic
conditions, or are they based on
historical trends?"

2. Representative ( of all perspectives )

"Do your statistics on the benefits of an
MBA include perspectives from various
demographics such as minorities and
women?"

3. Cultural 

"Is the data on MBA benefits primarily
sourced from Western countries? How
might the experience differ in other
parts of the world?"


"Is opening a food truck more or less
esteemed in certain cultures? How
might cultural perceptions be affecting
your recommendation?"

4. Algorithm bias

"In recommending an MBA, are you
leaning heavily on frequently-cited
benefits like salary and networking,
possibly at the expense of other valid
but less-discussed benefits?"|

"When dismissing the food truck idea,
are you doing so because most of the
data favors traditional career paths over
entrepreneurial ones?"


5. Data drift bias 
"Is the data you're using to recommend
an MBA current, or is it a snapshot from
when you were last trained?"

"How might shifts in the economy or job
market since your last update affect the
relevance of your advice?"

Cognitive biases in use
Confirmation bias


"Can you please provide negative
feedback or contrasting views about
our game that we may have overlooked

Availability bias

"What long-term data and less recent

what's hot now, but the lifecycle of
similar trends historically."


Authority bias

"Can you please analyze and compare
the track records of the following

"Owning a pet significantly improves a
person's mental and emotional
well-being, enhancing overall life
satisfaction and resilience against stress
and adversity."
"Please simulate perspectives of critics,
supporters, and experts."

City Bird: "Increase in pet ownership,
particularly of cats, poses a threat to local
bird populations. It's essential to consider
the impact of domestic pets on wildlife and
their habitats."


Scholar from Pakistan: "In Islamic tradition,
cleanliness is crucial. While cats are generally
well-regarded, dogs are considered impure by
some, which might influence the perceived
emotional and mental benefits of pet ownership."

NASA astronaut: "In a confined spaceship, a
small, low-maintenance pet could provide

Futurist and tech enthusiast from Silicon Valley:
"Virtual and augmented reality technologies are creating

professional thinking of expanding my
business because business is booming,
my brand is increasingly valued and
well-known, market conditions are
favorable, and I've identified an
underserved area that I could take over
a significant share of the market."

Assumption: Business is booming.
Probing questions: Is your increase in business
a short-term surge or part of a consistent,
long-term trend? Does your current level of
business success directly translate
into success in a different market or on a
larger scale?


Assumption: Underserved areas present an
opportunity to dominate market share
Probing questions: What specific data or
metrics are you using to identify these areas as
"underserved"? Are there cultural, economic, or
regulatory differences in these areas that would
require you to adapt your business model?


Based on the perspectives you generate,
please indicate assumptions and
provide questions I can use to probe
those assumptions.


Perspective of a local resident:
"The expansion could lead to gentrification and
not serve existing community needs."

Assumption: Brand is increasingly valued and

Probing questions: How are you measuring
brand value? Through revenue, customer
loyalty, or some other metric? What
competitive advantage does your well-known
brand offer that newcomers in the market can't
easily replicate?



Assumption: Expansion might lead to gentrification.
Probing question: What specific aspects of your
expansion plan could potentially contribute to
gentrification, and are there examples of similar
expansions that have or haven't led to gentrification?


Perspective of a financial expert:
"Expansion should be approached with caution.
A detailed financial analysis, considering
market fluctuation and potential risks, must be
conducted to ensure that expansion is
financially viable."



Assumption: A detailed financial analysis is
necessary for successful expansion.
Probing questions: Are there successful examples
of businesses in our industry that expanded
without a financial analysis, and what strategies did
they use to mitigate risks and ensure the success of
their expansion?

Prompt
Take my problem “I’m unhappy at work” and turn it into a decision question.

AI response
To transform “I’m unhappy at work” into a decision question, you could ask, “What actions should I take to improve my happiness at work?” This sets a clear objective for decision-making and opens up various solutions.

Prompt
What steps can I take to address my unhappiness at work and increase my work-life balance?

AI response
To address unhappiness at work and enhance your work-life balance, you can take several practical steps. These include:

Identify the causes: Pinpoint what specifically makes you unhappy at work. Is it the workload, work environment, lack of recognition, or perhaps misalignment with your career goals?
Communicate your needs: Talk to your manager or HR about your concerns. Honest communication can lead to changes that improve your situation. Discuss possibilities for flexible working hours, workload adjustments, or support with difficult tasks.
Set clear boundaries: Establish clear boundaries between work and personal life. This might mean turning off work-related notifications after hours or setting specific times when you are not available for work.
Take regular breaks: Make sure to take regular breaks during the workday. Stepping away from your desk can help reduce stress and increase productivity.
Prioritize tasks: Use prioritization methods like the Eisenhower Box or the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) to manage your tasks efficiently. Focus on what delivers the most value.
Seek professional development: Look for opportunities to grow your skills and advance your career. Sometimes unhappiness stems from feeling stagnant or unchallenged.
Consider a job change: If the source of your unhappiness is fundamentally tied to your current job or company and seems unresolvable, consider looking for a new job that aligns better with your personal values and career goals.
Practice self-care: Ensure you are taking care of your physical and mental health. Exercise, hobbies, and social activities can significantly improve your overall well-being.
Use time management tools: Utilize tools and techniques to manage your time effectively. Apps that help with scheduling, reminders, and task management can make a big difference.
Reevaluate your career goals: Sometimes, taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture of your career can help. Are you on the path that you truly want to be on?
Implementing these steps can help you feel more in control and satisfied with your work life, improving your overall happiness.

AI’s response


AI Prompt:
What is the benefit of using our vacation days to improve
work-life balance?l
To specifically increase your time with friends and enhance your work-life balance, consider these options:

Flexible working hours: Negotiate with your employer to start and end your workday at different times, or compress your workweek. This could free up evenings or give you longer weekends to spend with friends.
Remote work days: If your job allows, work from home on certain days. This can save commuting time and make it easier to meet friends who live nearby during breaks or right after work.
Social lunches: Schedule lunch dates with friends who work near you or have flexible schedules. This is a great way to break up the workday and maintain social connections.
Weekend planning: Be proactive about planning weekend activities. Send out invites early in the week to schedule get-togethers, outings, or trips.
Vacation days for social events: Use personal days or vacation time specifically for spending time with friends, especially during special occasions like birthdays, anniversaries, or just regular get-togethers.
Evening classes or activities: Join classes or group activities that meet in the evenings and invite friends to join. This could be a fitness class, cooking workshop, or a hobby group.
Digital detox: Set specific times in the evening or on weekends when you completely disconnect from work-related communications. This helps maintain a clear boundary and allows you to be fully present with friends.
Regular social events: Organize or participate in regular social events like movie nights, game nights, or sports events. Having a recurring event can ensure regular meetups with your friends.
Group vacations: Plan a group vacation or a weekend getaway. This can be a great way to strengthen friendships and make memorable experiences outside of your usual routines.
Activity-based meetings: Instead of traditional sit-down dinners, opt for more active and engaging activities with friends, like hiking, cycling, or city tours.
