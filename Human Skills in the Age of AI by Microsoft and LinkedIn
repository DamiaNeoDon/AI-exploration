@@@@@@@Create Your Email Blueprint @@@@@@@@@ Remember, the more you put in upfront, the more Al can work for you. @@@|
1. List three adjectives to describe your

@@@@@ Critical thinking questions

"How reliable are the sources you used
to analyze the demand for puffer scarves and oversized earmuffs?"


"Is the data recent and relevant to
Northern California?"

a demand for these winter items?"



"Are these trending hashtags related to
cold weather in California, or are they
tied to something else, like an online TV
show launch party?"


"Is the data relevant given variables like
marketing campaigns, wildfires,
economic or regulatory conditions,
shifting trends?"




@@@@
Biases in GEN AI 
1. Historical 

"Is the information on MBA earning
potential based on recent data from
(insert current year), or could it be
influenced by periods where an MBA
was perhaps more valuable?"


"Do the career paths for the MBA you
mention reflect current economic
conditions, or are they based on
historical trends?"

2. Representative ( of all perspectives )

"Do your statistics on the benefits of an
MBA include perspectives from various
demographics such as minorities and
women?"

3. Cultural 

"Is the data on MBA benefits primarily
sourced from Western countries? How
might the experience differ in other
parts of the world?"


"Is opening a food truck more or less
esteemed in certain cultures? How
might cultural perceptions be affecting
your recommendation?"

4. Algorithm bias

"In recommending an MBA, are you
leaning heavily on frequently-cited
benefits like salary and networking,
possibly at the expense of other valid
but less-discussed benefits?"|

"When dismissing the food truck idea,
are you doing so because most of the
data favors traditional career paths over
entrepreneurial ones?"


5. Data drift bias 
"Is the data you're using to recommend
an MBA current, or is it a snapshot from
when you were last trained?"

"How might shifts in the economy or job
market since your last update affect the
relevance of your advice?"



@@@@@@

Cognitive biases in use
Confirmation bias


"Can you please provide negative
feedback or contrasting views about
our game that we may have overlooked
or dismissed?"


"Can you please provide data and
analyses that show we're unintentionally
favoring positive outcomes?"|



Availability bias

"What long-term data and less recent
events should we consider for this
decision? Help me understand not just
what's hot now, but the lifecycle of
similar trends historically."


Authority bias

"Can you please analyze and compare
the track records of the following
analysts in predicting the success of
previous trading card games,
highlighting any disparities or
inaccuracies in their past judgments?"

"Please share the names of the authority
figures you're relying on."

"Please share examples where
widely-recognized experts in gaming
missed emerging trends or shifts in the
trading card game market."
